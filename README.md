# **First Audio Plugin**

## **Overview**

Hello! I'm making my first audio plugin with JUCE. Music plugins are my favourite thing to buy and I've always been curious to make one myself. This is a repository to document the process, test things out and make mistakes.

This is a side project for when I have a bit of free time so please bear with - the updates will be a little slow!

## **First Issue!**

I'm using a tutorial to guide me through JUCE/Projucer setups and eventually making a plugin. JUCE & Projucer are installed, I'm scanning for the plugin file I've built and have already hit a problem...

When I do *build > options > edit the list of available plugins > options > scan for new or updated VST3s > scan* Projucer crashes.

I get the error code: **EXC_BAD_ACCESS** on line 993

Did some Googling and tried enabling zombie objects in Xcode to fix it. Used the same method as above to crash the program again andâ€¦ got a different error message?!

**Line 232 EXC_BREAKPOINT code=EXC_i386_BPT**

Wondered if it would work with a different scan mode - changed scan mode to **out-of-process**. It no longer crashed and succesfully scanned!

However, I was scanning plugins to find the plugin Iâ€™m making and it wasnâ€™t there ðŸ˜‚. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s being built, as it doesn't seem to be *anywhere* on my system. 

Maybe the JUCE installation process went wrong? Tried reinstalling JUCE (via the website) and the plugin still isn't appearing in the list. 

I have some more things to try. Will update these notes soon!
